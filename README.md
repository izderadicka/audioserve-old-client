# Old Web Client

In process to be decommissioned - will be around for some time - ultimately to be removed into separate project.
Check new [web client](https://github.com/izderadicka/audioserve-web).

## How to use

Just build in this directory like this:
```
npm install &&\
npm run build ;\
```

and copy `dist` directory where audioserve will see it (`<working_dir>/client/dist`) or use audiosrve argument `--client-dir` to point to `dist` dir.
